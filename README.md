# LinqPad + Docker + Microsoft SQL Server

A small template that:

1. Spins up a Microsoft SQL Server in Docker
2. Waits for it to be healthy
3. Executes your SQL and C#
4. Stops the MSSQL container, removes it

Theres a little flag that also lets you skip the creation and deletion of the container if you need a more rapid development experience.
